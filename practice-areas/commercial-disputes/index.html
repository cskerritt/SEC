<h2>Business Valuation for Commercial Litigation</h2>
<p>Commercial disputes often center on the value of businesses, economic losses from breached contracts, or the treatment of business partners. Whether addressing shareholder oppression, partnership dissolution, breach of contract damages, or business interruption claims, accurate business valuation and economic loss analysis is important for dispute resolution.</p>
<p>Our commercial litigation experience spans closely held business disputes, partnership and LLC disagreements, merger and acquisition disputes, non-compete and trade secret violations, and breach of contract cases involving business damages. We provide the economic foundation that attorneys need to present compelling cases in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and throughout New England commercial courts.</p>

<!-- FAQ Section -->
<div class="faq-section">
<h2>Commercial Litigation FAQ</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: What's the difference between fair market value and fair value?</h4>
<p>A: Fair market value assumes a willing buyer and seller with full knowledge, typically including marketability discounts for minority interests. Fair value, often used in shareholder disputes, may exclude marketability discounts and consider the specific circumstances of the transaction or dispute.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: How do you calculate lost profits in breach of contract cases?</h4>
<p>A: We develop a "but-for" analysis comparing actual business performance to what would have occurred without the breach. This requires analyzing historical trends, market conditions, and the specific impact of the breaching party's actions while ensuring lost profits are reasonably certain and not speculative.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: Can you handle complex business structures like LLCs and partnerships?</h4>
<p>A: Yes, we regularly value interests in LLCs, partnerships, S-corporations, and other pass-through entities. These structures require special consideration of tax implications, distribution policies, and operating agreement provisions that affect value.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: Do you provide business interruption analysis for insurance claims?</h4>
<p>A: Yes, we calculate business interruption losses for insurance claims and coverage disputes. This includes analyzing lost income, continuing expenses, and extra costs incurred during the interruption period, while ensuring calculations comply with policy language and coverage limitations.</p>
