<!-- FAQ Section -->
<div class="faq-section">
<h2>Employment Litigation FAQ</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: How do you calculate front pay in wrongful termination cases?</h4>
<p>A: Front pay calculations consider the employee's likely career trajectory, including promotions, raises, and benefit improvements they would have received but for the wrongful termination. We analyze company promotion patterns, industry standards, and the individual's performance history to project future earnings accurately.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: What is mitigation of damages and how does it affect calculations?</h4>
<p>A: Mitigation requires plaintiffs to make reasonable efforts to find comparable employment. We analyze job search activities, available positions, and actual alternative employment to determine appropriate reductions in damage awards. The analysis should balance the duty to mitigate with the requirement that alternative employment be truly comparable.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: Can you handle class action employment cases?</h4>
<p>A: Yes, we regularly work on class action employment litigation including wage and hour violations, discrimination cases, and benefits disputes. Our statistical expertise and experience with large datasets enables us to efficiently analyze damages for multiple class members while maintaining accuracy and defensibility.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<h4>Q: How do you address executive compensation in employment disputes?</h4>
<p>A: Executive compensation cases require specialized analysis of base salary, bonus structures, equity compensation, and complex benefit packages. We work with compensation consultants and review industry benchmarking data to accurately quantify the full value of executive compensation packages and calculate appropriate damages.</p>
