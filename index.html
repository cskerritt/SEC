<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Forensic Economics Services</h2>
<div class="faq-grid">
<details class="faq-item">
<summary>What types of cases do forensic economists handle?</summary>
<p>Forensic economists provide expert analysis for personal injury, wrongful death, medical malpractice, employment litigation, commercial disputes, and business valuation cases. We calculate economic damages including lost earnings, fringe benefits, household services, life care costs, and business interruption losses. Our services support both plaintiff and defense counsel across all major litigation areas requiring economic damage assessment.</p>
</details>
<details class="faq-item">
<summary>When should I hire a forensic economist?</summary>
<p>Engage a forensic economist early in the case development process, ideally during discovery. Early involvement allows for proper case evaluation, identification of necessary documentation, and coordination with other experts. For cases involving significant economic damages, early engagement can help shape discovery requests and settlement strategy.</p>
</details>
<details class="faq-item">
<summary>How long does it take to prepare a forensic economics report?</summary>
<p>Standard reports typically require 2-4 weeks depending on case complexity and document availability. Rush analyses can be accommodated with shorter timeframes when necessary.

</details>
<details class="faq-item">
