                    <summary>What types of cases do forensic economists handle?</summary>
                    <p>Forensic economists provide expert analysis for personal injury, wrongful death, medical malpractice, employment litigation, commercial disputes, and business valuation cases. We calculate economic damages including lost earnings, fringe benefits, household services, life care costs, and business interruption losses. Our services support both plaintiff and defense counsel across all major litigation areas requiring economic damage assessment.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>When should I hire a forensic economist?</summary>
                    <p>Engage a forensic economist early in the case development process, ideally during discovery. Early involvement allows for proper case evaluation, identification of necessary documentation, and coordination with other experts. For cases involving significant economic damages, early engagement can help shape discovery requests and settlement strategy.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What information do you need to begin your analysis?</summary>
                    <p>We typically require employment records, tax returns, pay stubs, benefit statements, and medical records related to injury or disability. For business cases, financial statements, tax returns, and operational data are essential. We provide a detailed document request list tailored to each case type and can work with incomplete information during preliminary analysis.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How long does it take to prepare a report?</summary>
                    <p>Standard reports typically require 2-4 weeks depending on case complexity and document availability. Rush analyses can be accommodated with shorter timeframes when necessary. We provide estimated timelines during initial consultation and maintain communication throughout the process to ensure deadlines are met.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">

                    <p>We use established methodologies including worklife expectancy tables, wage growth projections based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and present value calculations using appropriate discount rates. Our analyses consider factors such as education, occupation, industry trends, and individual circumstances while following accepted economic principles.</p>

                    <summary>How do you handle uncertainty in economic projections?</summary>
                    <p>We acknowledge uncertainty through sensitivity analyses, alternative scenarios, and confidence intervals where appropriate. Our reports clearly state assumptions and provide ranges of potential outcomes. This approach allows counsel to understand the strength of different damage components and prepare for cross-examination.</p>
                </details>
                
                <details class="faq-item">

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How do you explain complex economic concepts to juries?</summary>
                    <p>We use clear language, visual aids, and real-world analogies to make economic concepts accessible to lay audiences.
