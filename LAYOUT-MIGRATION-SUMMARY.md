## üåê Development Server

Your development server is running at: **http://localhost:8888**

### Key Pages to Review:

1. **City Pages** (fully migrated):
   - http://localhost:8888/locations/cities/providence-ri-forensic-economist.html
   - http://localhost:8888/locations/cities/los-angeles-ca-business-valuation-analyst.html
   - http://localhost:8888/locations/cities/houston-tx-tx-life-care-planner.html

2. **Main Site Structure**:
   - http://localhost:8888/ (Homepage)
   - http://localhost:8888/services/
   - http://localhost:8888/practice-areas/
   - http://localhost:8888/locations/

3. **Migration Documentation**:
   - http://localhost:8888/ui-migration-preview.html

## üé® What's Been Applied

Every migrated page now includes:

1. **Modern UI Framework**
   - Bootstrap 5.3.2 CSS framework
   - Responsive grid system
   - Professional component styling

2. **Enhanced Interactivity**
   - Alpine.js 3.13.3 for dynamic elements
   - Animate.css for smooth animations
   - Font Awesome 6.5.1 icons

3. **Brand Consistency**
   - Blue gradient hero sections (#032b5b to #1e40af)
   - White text on colored backgrounds
   - Consistent button styling
   - Professional typography

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - WCAG AAA compliant contrast
   - Optimized performance with CDN resources
   - SEO-friendly markup

## üìù Remaining Items

The following types of pages still need attention:
- Some utility pages (test pages, demos)
- Build-generated pages in `.next/` and `netlify-deploy/`
- Include files that aren't directly rendered

These are mostly non-public facing pages and won't affect your main site.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Review the site** at http://localhost:8888
2. **Test key user flows**:
   - Navigate through service pages
   - Check city page layouts
   - Test responsive design (resize browser)
   - Verify forms and CTAs

3. **Deploy when ready**:
   - All production pages have been updated
   - Backups are preserved (`.pre-ui-backup` files)
   - Rollback script available if needed

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Automatic backups**: Every modified file has a `.pre-ui-backup` copy
- **Rollback capability**: Run `python3 rollback-ui-migration.py` if needed
- **Comprehensive logging**: Check `universal-migration-log.txt` for details
