<h2>What Is a Forensic Economist?</h2>
<p>A forensic economist is an expert witness who specializes in calculating economic damages in legal cases. Our forensic economics services provide the quantitative foundation for economic damage claims in <a href="../../practice-areas/personal-injury/">personal injury</a>, <a href="../../practice-areas/personal-injury/">wrongful death</a>, and <a href="../../practice-areas/employment/">employment litigation</a> throughout Rhode Island and New England. We translate complex financial losses into clear, defensible calculations that support fair compensation for individuals and families affected by negligence, accidents, or wrongful conduct.</p>
<p>As experienced forensic economists, we analyze lost earnings, future medical costs, household services value, and other economic losses using accepted methodologies that meet court reliability standards. Whether addressing catastrophic injury cases requiring lifetime care, <a href="../../practice-areas/personal-injury/">wrongful death claims</a> involving economic support to survivors, or <a href="../../practice-areas/employment/">employment disputes</a> involving lost wages and benefits, our forensic economic analysis ensures that all economic losses are properly identified, calculated, and presented to courts and juries.</p>
<p>Our role as a forensic economist extends beyond simple calculations. We work closely with attorneys to understand case specifics, coordinate with medical and vocational experts, and provide clear expert testimony that helps judges and juries understand the true economic impact of injuries or wrongful acts. This comprehensive approach has made us a trusted resource for attorneys throughout Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the broader New England region.</p>

<!-- When Is Economic Analysis Needed -->
<div class="service-section">
<h2>When Is Economic Analysis Needed?</h2>
<p>Economic damages analysis by a forensic economist is essential in various legal scenarios where financial losses must be quantified for fair compensation. Understanding when to engage a forensic economist can significantly impact case outcomes and settlement negotiations.</p>
<h3>Key Situations Requiring Forensic Economic Analysis:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="../../practice-areas/personal-injury/">Personal Injury</a> Cases:</strong> When injuries result in lost wages, reduced earning capacity, or ongoing medical expenses</li>
<li><strong><a href="../../practice-areas/personal-injury/">Wrongful Death</a> Claims:</strong> To calculate lost financial support, household services, and economic contributions to survivors</li>
<li><strong><a href="../../practice-areas/employment/">Employment Litigation</a>:</strong> For determining back pay, front pay, and lost benefits in discrimination or wrongful termination cases</li>
<li><strong><a href="../../practice-areas/medical-malpractice/">Medical Malpractice</a>:</strong> When medical errors lead to permanent disability, reduced work capacity, or lifetime care needs</li>
<li><strong><a href="../../practice-areas/commercial-disputes/">Business Disputes</a>:</strong> To assess lost profits, business interruption damages, or breach of contract losses</li>
</ul>
<p>Early engagement of a forensic economist provides strategic advantages, including accurate case valuation for settlement negotiations, identification of all economic loss categories, and development of compelling damage presentations for mediation or trial.</p>
