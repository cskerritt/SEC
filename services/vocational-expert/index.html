This analysis provides the foundation for calculating economic damages in personal injury, workers' compensation, and disability litigation throughout Rhode Island and New England.</p>
<p>My vocational assessments integrate medical evidence, functional capacity evaluations, educational background, work history, and current labor market data to provide comprehensive opinions on work capability. This multidisciplinary approach ensures that attorneys receive thorough, defensible analyses that address all aspects of vocational functioning and economic loss.</p>

<!-- FAQ Section -->
<div class="service-section" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/FAQPage">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-accordion">
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">What information does a vocational expert need to assess employability?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">A vocational expert typically needs medical records, functional capacity evaluations, education and training records, detailed work history, earnings documentation, and any vocational testing results. We also review deposition transcripts and may conduct interviews to fully understand the individual's vocational profile and limitations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">How does a vocational expert determine lost earning capacity?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Vocational experts analyze pre-injury earnings history and career trajectory, then compare this to post-injury earning capacity based on residual functional abilities, transferable skills, and labor market conditions. We consider factors like job availability, wage levels, probability of employment, and work-life expectancy to calculate economic loss.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">What is the difference between employability and earning capacity?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Employability refers to the ability to obtain and maintain competitive employment, while earning capacity represents the monetary value of that employment potential. A person may be employable but at a significantly reduced earning capacity due to limitations, need for accommodations, or restriction to lower-paying occupations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">How do vocational experts assess transferable skills?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Vocational experts use systematic analysis tools like the DOT (Dictionary of Occupational Titles) and O*NET to identify skills gained from past work that can transfer to other occupations. We evaluate factors like skill level, physical demands, work environment, and industry-specific vs. general skills to identify suitable alternative employment options.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">When should attorneys engage a vocational expert?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Attorneys should engage a vocational expert early in cases involving work-related losses, ideally after medical stability is achieved but before settlement negotiations. Early involvement allows for comprehensive assessment, identification of rehabilitation needs, and coordination with other experts like economists and life care planners for integrated damage calculations.</p>
