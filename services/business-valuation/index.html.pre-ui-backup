<!-- What Is Business Valuation -->
<div class="service-section">
<h2>What Is Business Valuation?</h2>
<p>Business valuation is the process of determining the economic value of a business, professional practice, or ownership interest. As a certified valuation expert, I use recognized methodologies to establish defensible values for closely-held businesses, partnership interests, and professional practices. Business valuation provides the foundation for resolving disputes in litigation, divorce proceedings, shareholder conflicts, and estate matters throughout Rhode Island and New England.</p>
<p>With extensive experience in vocational rehabilitation and forensic economics, I bring a unique perspective as a valuation analyst, particularly in cases involving professional practices, service businesses, and companies where key-person issues affect value. My analyses address both economic value and the human capital factors that drive business performance, providing attorneys with comprehensive litigation support.</p>

<!-- FAQ Section -->
<div class="service-section" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/FAQPage">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-accordion">
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">What financial information does a business valuation expert need?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">A business valuation expert typically needs 3-5 years of financial statements, tax returns, general ledger detail, accounts receivable/payable aging, fixed asset listings, and any existing buy-sell agreements. For professional practices, we also need patient/client lists, referral sources, and partnership agreements to complete a comprehensive business appraisal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">How does a valuation analyst determine the appropriate valuation date?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">The valuation date depends on legal requirements and case purpose. In Rhode Island divorce cases, it may be the filing date, separation date, or trial date. For shareholder disputes, it's typically the triggering event date. Your business appraiser works with attorneys to select the appropriate date based on case facts and applicable law.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">When do business valuation experts apply marketability or minority discounts?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Discount application depends on the standard of value. In fair market value contexts, marketability and minority discounts may apply. In Rhode Island fair value cases (like dissenting shareholder actions), discounts may be limited. A qualified business appraiser analyzes each case based on applicable law and professional standards.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">How do valuation analysts distinguish personal from enterprise goodwill?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Business valuation experts analyze the practitioner's reputation, referral sources, non-compete agreements, and practice systems to distinguish personal (non-transferable) from enterprise (transferable) goodwill. This distinction is crucial in Rhode Island divorce cases where personal goodwill may not be marital property requiring division.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="faq-item" itemprop="mainEntity" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
<h4 itemprop="name">How quickly can attorneys get preliminary business valuations for litigation support?</h4>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
<p itemprop="text">Business appraisers can provide preliminary value ranges within 5-7 days to help Rhode Island attorneys assess case economics and settlement positions. Full valuation reports from a qualified business valuation expert typically require 3-4 weeks, depending on complexity and information availability.</p>
