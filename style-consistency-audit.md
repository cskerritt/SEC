# Website Style Consistency Audit Report
**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Auditor:** Claude Code  
**Website:** Skerritt Economics & Consulting

## Executive Summary

This audit reveals several inconsistencies across the website pages in navigation structure, footer content, CSS class usage, HTML patterns, and inline styles. While the overall structure is consistent, there are notable variations that should be addressed for better maintainability and user experience.

## 1. Navigation Menu Differences

### Inconsistent Dropdown Items
- **About page** (about/index.html): 
  - Services dropdown only shows 2 items: "Forensic Economics" and "Business Valuation"
  - Missing: "Vocational Expert" and "Life Care Planning"
  
- **Services page** (services/index.html):
  - Services dropdown shows all 4 items: "Forensic Economics", "Business Valuation", "Vocational Expert", "Life Care Planning"
  
- **Homepage and other pages**:
  - Most pages link to services with hashtags: `services/#vocational-assessment` and `services/#life-care-planning`
  - Services page itself links to dedicated pages: `services/vocational-expert/` and `services/life-care-planning/`

### Missing Nav Items
- **Homepage** (index.html): 
  - Includes "Locations" and "Tools" menu items
  - Order: Home, Services, Practice Areas, Case Studies, **Locations**, About, Resources, **Tools**, Contact

- **All other pages**:
  - Missing "Locations" and "Tools" from navigation
  - Order: Home, Services, Practice Areas, Case Studies, About, Resources, Contact

### Active State Marking
- Proper active class usage on current pages (e.g., `class="active"` on About when on about page)
- However, parent items not marked active when on child pages

## 2. Footer Content Differences

### Footer Column Variations
- **Homepage** has a 5th column "Major Cities" with location links:
  ```html
  <div class="footer-col">
    <h4>Major Cities</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="locations/cities/new-york-ny-forensic-economist.html">New York Forensic Economist</a></li>
      <!-- ... more cities ... -->
    </ul>
  </div>
  ```

- **All other pages** also have this 5th column but with incorrect relative paths:
  - Uses `/locations/cities/` instead of `../locations/cities/`
  - This will cause 404 errors on subpages

### Inconsistent Footer Links
- **Contact page** footer has additional/different service links:
  - Includes "Economic Loss Analysis" and "Expert Testimony" not found in other footers
  - Has "Success Stories" link instead of consistent naming

### Missing Links
- No "Tools" link in any footer despite being in homepage navigation
- No "Locations" overview page link in footer

## 3. Inconsistent CSS Class Usage

### Hero Section Classes
- **Homepage**: Uses `hero` class with gradient background
- **About page**: Uses `about-hero` class
- **Other pages**: Use `page-header` class

### Section Naming Inconsistencies
- Homepage: `services-overview`, `trust-signals`, `practice-areas`
- Services page: `services-overview`, `methodology-overview`, `process-section`
- Practice Areas: `practice-areas-content`
- Inconsistent naming convention (hyphenated vs. non-hyphenated)

### Grid Class Variations
- `services-grid` vs. `benefits-grid` vs. `credentials-grid`
- `case-studies-grid` vs. `case-preview-grid`
- No clear naming convention for grid layouts

## 4. Different HTML Structure Patterns

### Breadcrumb Implementation
- **Homepage**: No breadcrumb navigation
- **All other pages**: Include breadcrumb navigation
- Some breadcrumbs have trailing commas in JSON-LD (line 221 in services/index.html)

### Icon Usage
- **Emoji icons** used extensively: üìä, üè¢, üéØ, üè•, ‚öñÔ∏è, üíº
- No consistent icon system or fallback for non-supporting browsers
- Mix of emoji and text-based icons (e.g., "‚úì" for checkmarks)

### Button Variations
- `btn btn-primary` vs. `btn btn-outline` vs. `btn btn-secondary`
- Inconsistent use of `btn-large` modifier
- Some buttons have `btn-with-icon` class, others just include icons

## 5. Inline Styles That Should Be in CSS

### Direct Style Attributes Found
1. **Phone number styling** (appears in all footers):
   ```html
   <span style="font-size: 0.9em;">(Direct)</span>
   ```

2. **Homepage hero section** (lines 38-744):
   - Massive inline `<style>` block with 700+ lines of CSS
   - Should be moved to external stylesheet

### Embedded Analytics Scripts
- Google Analytics code embedded directly in HTML
- Contains placeholder `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` that needs configuration
- Tracking functions defined inline rather than in external JS

## 6. Additional Findings

### Missing Structured Data
- Inconsistent schema.org implementation across pages
- Some pages missing breadcrumb structured data

### Accessibility Concerns
- Skip navigation link only on homepage
- Inconsistent aria-labels on interactive elements
- No alt text strategy for emoji icons

### JavaScript Dependencies
- Different JS files loaded per page:
  - Homepage: `js/main.js`
  - Case Studies: `js/main.js` and `js/case-studies.js`
  - Contact: `js/main.js` and `js/contact.js`
- No consistent loading strategy

## Recommendations

1. **Navigation Standardization**
   - Create a single navigation template/component
   - Ensure all pages have identical menu structure
   - Fix service dropdown links consistency
   - Add "Locations" and "Tools" to all pages or remove from homepage

2. **Footer Consolidation**
   - Create single footer template with correct relative paths
   - Standardize service links across all pages
   - Fix location links paths on subpages

3. **CSS Organization**
   - Move all inline styles to external stylesheets
   - Create consistent naming convention for sections and grids
   - Implement proper icon system (consider icon fonts or SVGs)

4. **HTML Structure**
   - Standardize hero/header sections across pages
   - Implement consistent breadcrumb on all pages except homepage
   - Create reusable component patterns

5. **Code Cleanup**
   - Configure Google Analytics properly
   - Move tracking scripts to external files
   - Implement proper build process for consistency

## Priority Actions

1. **High Priority**: Fix broken footer location links on subpages
2. **High Priority**: Standardize navigation across all pages
3. **Medium Priority**: Move inline styles to CSS files
4. **Medium Priority**: Implement consistent icon system
5. **Low Priority**: Standardize class naming conventions

## Conclusion

While the website maintains reasonable consistency in overall design, numerous small inconsistencies create maintenance challenges and potential user confusion. Implementing a component-based approach with shared templates would resolve most issues and improve long-term maintainability.
