  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-grid">

  <!-- Service-Related Questions -->
  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What types of cases do forensic economists typically handle?</summary>
  <p>Forensic economists provide expert analysis in personal injury, wrongful death, employment litigation, commercial damages, and divorce cases. We calculate economic losses including lost earnings, fringe benefits, household services, medical costs, and business valuations. Our expertise spans both plaintiff and defense work across state and federal courts.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>When should I hire a forensic economist for my case?</summary>
  <p>Engage a forensic economist as early as possible after case evaluation, ideally during the discovery phase. Early involvement allows for comprehensive damage analysis, assists with deposition preparation, and helps identify key economic issues. This timing also ensures adequate preparation for settlement negotiations or trial testimony.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can a forensic economist help with both liability and damages?</summary>
  <p>While forensic economists primarily focus on quantifying economic damages, we can assist with liability issues involving economic analysis, such as market conditions, industry standards, or statistical discrimination patterns. Our reports often provide context that supports both liability arguments and damage calculations, particularly in employment and commercial cases.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Process Questions -->
  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What information do you need to begin an economic analysis?</summary>
  <p>Initial requirements typically include the complaint, medical records (for injury cases), employment history, tax returns, W-2s, and relevant depositions. For business cases, we need financial statements, tax returns, and industry data. We'll provide a detailed document request list specific to your case type upon engagement.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How long does it take to prepare an expert report?</summary>
  <p>A comprehensive economic report typically requires 4-6 weeks from receipt of complete documentation. Complex commercial cases may require 6-8 weeks. Rush services are available for expedited deadlines, though adequate time ensures thorough analysis and strengthens the report's defensibility under rigorous scrutiny.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Will you coordinate with other experts on the case?</summary>
  <p>Yes, we regularly collaborate with vocational experts, life care planners, and medical professionals to ensure comprehensive and consistent damage calculations. This coordination strengthens the overall case presentation and helps avoid contradictions between expert opinions. We can participate in joint strategy sessions as needed.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Court-Related Questions -->
  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Are your reports admissible under court reliability standards?</summary>
  <p>Our reports are specifically designed to meet court and Frye standards, utilizing peer-reviewed methodologies and government data sources. We provide detailed explanations of our methods, assumptions, and calculations to withstand admissibility challenges. Our economists maintain current knowledge of evolving admissibility standards across jurisdictions.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How do you prepare for deposition and trial testimony?</summary>
  <p>We conduct thorough preparation sessions with counsel, reviewing key report elements and anticipated rigorous scrutiny topics. Our experts are experienced witnesses who present complex economic concepts in clear, accessible language for judges and juries. We provide demonstrative exhibits and can assist with direct examination questions.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can you provide rebuttal analysis of opposing experts?</summary>
  <p>Rebuttal analysis is a core service where we critically evaluate opposing expert reports, identifying methodological flaws, unreasonable assumptions, and calculation errors. We prepare detailed rebuttal reports and can testify about these critiques. This service often reveals significant overstatements or understatements in damage calculations.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Cost/Billing Questions -->
  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How are forensic economics services typically billed?</summary>
  <p>Most forensic economists bill hourly, with rates varying by experience and case complexity ($300-$800/hour is typical). We require retainers for new clients, applied against hourly charges. Some economists offer flat fees for routine analyses. Travel time and expenses for depositions and trial are billed separately.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What is the typical cost range for a forensic economic analysis?</summary>
  <p>Basic personal injury analyses typically range from $5,000-$15,000, while complex commercial cases can exceed $50,000. Costs depend on case complexity, data availability, and testimony requirements. We provide detailed estimates after initial case review and can structure payment arrangements for contingency cases.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- Technical Questions -->
  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What methodologies do you use for calculating future losses?</summary>
  <p>We employ standard economic methodologies including human capital approach, present value analysis, and life-cycle earnings models. Calculations incorporate age-earnings profiles, worklife expectancy, inflation, and appropriate discount rates based on current economic data. All methods are supported by peer-reviewed literature and government statistics.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How do you account for uncertainty in economic projections?</summary>
  <p>We address uncertainty through sensitivity analysis, presenting ranges of reasonable outcomes based on varying assumptions. Our reports clearly state all assumptions and provide alternative calculations under different scenarios. This approach helps attorneys understand the economic risks and strengthens settlement negotiations.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Do you use jurisdiction-specific data in your calculations?</summary>
  <p>Yes, we incorporate state and local data including wage rates, employment statistics, tax implications, and cost-of-living adjustments. This localized approach provides more accurate and defensible damage calculations. We maintain databases of jurisdiction-specific economic factors and legal requirements.</p>
  </details>

  <details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can you explain complex economic concepts to a jury?</summary>
  <p>Effective jury communication is essential to our practice. We use clear analogies, visual aids, and straightforward language to explain concepts like present value, inflation adjustments, and statistical analysis. Our experts are trained to avoid jargon and respond to jury questions in accessible terms while maintaining technical accuracy.</p>
